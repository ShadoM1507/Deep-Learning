# Deep Neural Network - Application

In the second week, was used logistic regression to build cat vs. non-cat images and got a 70% accuracy.
This algorithm will now give an 80% accuracy!

- Learn how to use all the helper functions you built in the previous assignment to build a model of any structure you want.

- Experiment with different model architectures and see how each one behaves.

- Recognize that it is always easier to build your helper functions before attempting to build a neural network from scratch.
